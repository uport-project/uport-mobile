# uPort Mobile

uPort mobile is a secure mobile self-sovereign identity wallet that gives you complete control over your identity and personal data.

Using uPort you can:

* Create an identity on the Ethereum blockchain network
* Securely log-in to applications without passwords
* Manage your personal information and verifications
* Sign Ethereum transactions

This mobile wallet is your connection to the uPort platform, an interoperable identity network for a secure, private, decentralized web. uPort provides open protocols for decentralized identity and interoperable messaging that enable trusted source attribution for all web communication. By allowing message recipients to trust message senders without centralized servers, we can create an entirely new framework for building applications, and many developers are already building on this system.

[FAQ and helpdesk support](http://bit.ly/uPort_helpdesk)

## Getting started

### JavaScript environment setup

- Install yarn with `brew install yarn` or `npm install yarn -g`
- Install the latest version of Xcode
- Install React Native CLI

After cloning this repository cd into the directory

```bash=
$ yarn global add react-native-cli (to install CLI)
$ yarn
$ npx jetify
```

### Linking native libraries
Linking must be done manually. Do not run `react-native link` as this will mess up the exising links.


### IOS setup

- Install Xcode version 10+
- Install Xcode command line tools

#### Run from Xcode

Hit Run in X-Code and it should launch on your device. Simulator use may not support all features, always run on your device whenever possible.

#### Run from command line

```bash=
$ react-native run-ios
```

### Android setup

This step depends on the [JavaScript environment setup](#javascript-environment-setup).

It's also a good idea to run `yarn` every time you switch branches to sync the `node_modules` folder.

- Easiest way is to install Android Studio. This will manage the android SDK for you and makes life easier for non Android devs
- Select the custom install option and select options for performance and AVD creation
- Ensure to install both the minimum SDK 21 and the latest that the current version of React Native supports from the new project settings
- Since the app uses push messaging to receive signing requests from dApps it needs to be integrated into a Firebase project.
    A `google-services.json` file must be placed in the `android/app/` folder.
    You can get it by creating a project in the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

#### Run from Android Studio

- Load the `android` subfolder as a project in Android Studio

    **Do not upgrade any dependencies (gradle) if prompted by Android Studio**
    
- React native uses a packaging server to enable hot-reloading during debugging.
    
    You'll need to run `yarn start` in a terminal window in the project root folder to start the packager.
    This needs to be done only once for a debugging session and you can use the same server between app restarts.
    
- With a packaging server running, you can now run the `app` runConfiguration by pressing the green play button in the tool window.

- It will take a while to start the app for the first time because the packager needs to do it's job, during which you only see a splash-screen.   

#### Run from command line
After cloning repository, running `yarn` and also getting a `google-services.json` file,
Run this in the project root folder 
```bash=
$ react-native run-android
```
The above command also takes care of starting the packaging server.
It will take a while to start the app for the first time because the packager needs to do it's job, during which you only see a splash-screen.


## StandardJS

We're using StandardJS to maintain a consistent JavaScript style. Before submitting pull requests, please make sure that new code passes the StandardJS linter by running `npm run lint`. Some style errors can be fixed automatically by running `npm run lint-fix`. 

Alternatively, you can install StandardJS globally with `yarn global add standard`, and then for pretty output use Snazzy: `yarn global add snazzy` then `standard --verbose | snazzy`.

There are also a number of [text editor plugins](https://github.com/feross/standard#text-editor-plugins) available to highlight errors during development.   

## Unit Testing

We primarily use [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit testing. You can run all the tests once by typing:

```
yarn test
```

During development it's recommended that you leave the automatic testing code running in a window.

```
yarn test -- --watch
```

Jest tests of components, actions, reducers and selectors are mostly done using [Snapshotting](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing) which
means that tests will fail if you make any kind of change to a component being tested.

Have a look at the diff shown if the change is what you asked for. Type `u` to update the snapshot assuming you're using the automatic version of jest.
